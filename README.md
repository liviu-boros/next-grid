# NextGrid [&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¹&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;](https://)

NextGrid is a personal project where I studied UX design for websites, with a focus on researching company presentation sites. The project includes a custom design system for a hypothetical tech company website, detailing colors, fonts, icons, components, and patterns.

The presentation consists of several sections with high fidelity screens, such as who we are, what we do, how we work.
